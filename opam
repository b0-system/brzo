synopsis: "Quick-setting builds"
description: """\
Brzo is a build tool to quickly turn source files of various languages
into executable programs and documents.

Brzo favors best-effort heuristics and advices over formal
configuration. It is a simple build tool made for exploratory design
and learning. It is unsuitable for building software distributions.

Brzo partitions its build logics into *domains* which broadly map to
support for different languages. Each domain provides a few build
*outcomes* which determine a build artefact and an action performed on
it. The following domains are defined:

* `c`, C support. Outcomes for executable programs and source
  documentation via [Doxygen][doxygen]. 
* `cmark`, [CommonMark][commonmark] support. Outcomes for a web of
  HTML programs (via [cmark][cmark]).
* `latex`, [LaTeX][latex] support. Outcomes for PDF documents and
  source file listings.
* `ocaml`, [OCaml][ocaml] support. Outcomes for byte and native code
  executable programs with C bindings, HTML and JavaScript programs
  via [js_of_ocaml][jsoo], interactive toplevel sessions in the
  terminal and in the browser, source documentation and manuals.

Brzo is distributed under the ISC license, it depends on [`b0`][b0] and
[`cmdliner`][cmdliner]."""
